# Chapter 2: The Measurement Equation and Bayesian Framework

## 2.1 From Radiance to State — The Inverse Problem

The forward model tells us how to go from atmosphere → measurement.
The retrieval algorithm goes the other way: measurement → atmosphere.

This is an **ill-posed inverse problem** because:
1. We have fewer measurements than unknown state variables (underdetermined)
2. Many different atmospheric states can produce the same spectrum (non-unique)
3. Small measurement errors can produce large errors in the retrieved state
   if the forward model is not well-conditioned (ill-conditioned)

Bayesian inference provides the principled solution through the posterior P(x|y).

## 2.2 The State Vector and Prior

The **atmospheric state vector** x contains everything we want to retrieve.
For a temperature sounding problem:

    x = [T(p₁), T(p₂), ..., T(pN), T_s, ε_s]ᵀ ∈ ℝⁿ

For an aerosol retrieval:

    x = [AOD₅₅₀, α, ω₀, R_s(470nm), R_s(550nm), R_s(860nm)]ᵀ ∈ ℝ⁶

The **prior distribution** encodes our knowledge before the measurement:

    x ~ N(x_a, S_a)

where:
- x_a = **a priori** state (from climatology, NWP model, or previous retrieval)
- S_a = **a priori covariance matrix** (how uncertain we are about each element)

The a priori covariance S_a encodes both:
- **Variances** on the diagonal: σᵢ² = uncertainty in the i-th state element
- **Correlations** off-diagonal: adjacent atmospheric levels are correlated

## 2.3 The Likelihood — Instrument Noise Model

Assuming Gaussian instrument noise:

    ε ~ N(0, Sε)

where S_ε is the **measurement error covariance matrix**.

For independent channels: S_ε = diag(σ₁², σ₂², ..., σₘ²)

The log-likelihood is then:

$$\ln P(y | x) = -\frac{1}{2} [y - F(x)]^T S_\varepsilon^{-1} [y - F(x)] + \text{const}$$

This is equivalent to a weighted χ² misfit between measured and forward-modelled radiances.

## 2.4 The Full Bayesian Posterior

Combining prior and likelihood:

$$P(x | y) \propto P(y | x) \cdot P(x)$$

$$\ln P(x | y) = -\frac{1}{2}\underbrace{[y - F(x)]^T S_\varepsilon^{-1} [y - F(x)]}_\text{misfit to data} -\frac{1}{2}\underbrace{(x - x_a)^T S_a^{-1} (x - x_a)}_\text{penalty from prior} + \text{const}$$

The retrieval minimises the **cost function**:

$$\boxed{J(x) = [y - F(x)]^T S_\varepsilon^{-1} [y - F(x)] + (x - x_a)^T S_a^{-1} (x - x_a)}$$

This is the **generalised least squares** cost function. The second term is a
**Tikhonov regularisation** — it prevents unphysical solutions by penalising
departures from the a priori.

## 2.5 The Jacobian Matrix K

For a forward model F: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ, the Jacobian is:

$$K = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$

Each row Kᵢ tells us how measurement i responds to changes in all state elements.
Each column Kⱼ tells us how all measurements respond to changes in state element j.

**Computing K in practice:**
- Finite differences: K_ij = [F_i(x + δeⱼ) - F_i(x)] / δ  (slow, O(n) forward model calls)
- Analytic Jacobians: derived from the physics (fast, error-prone to code)
- Adjoint method: compute K^T v efficiently for any vector v (used in variational data assimilation)

## 2.6 Degrees of Freedom for Signal (DFS)

How much independent information does the measurement provide about the state?

    A = (KᵀSε⁻¹K + Sa⁻¹)⁻¹ KᵀSε⁻¹K    (Averaging kernel matrix)

The **degrees of freedom for signal** (DFS):

    d_s = trace(A) ∈ [0, n]

where n = dimension of state vector.

- d_s ≈ 0: measurement tells us nothing new (prior dominates)
- d_s ≈ n: measurement fully determines all state elements (data dominates)
- Typical IASI temperature sounding: d_s ≈ 8–12 for a 40-level profile

The averaging kernel matrix A tells us what the retrieval really measures:

    x̂ - x_a = A(x_true - x_a) + noise

Each row Aᵢ is the "true" profile that would be retrieved as a delta perturbation
at level i — a broader Aᵢ row means coarser vertical resolution.

## 2.7 Information Content

The **Shannon information content** gained from the measurement:

$$H = \frac{1}{2} \ln \det(I + S_a^{1/2} K^T S_\varepsilon^{-1} K S_a^{1/2})$$

This measures how much the posterior is "narrower" than the prior (in bits or nats).
Used to optimally select measurement channels that maximise retrieval information.

## 2.8 Error Budget

The total retrieval error has contributions:

| Source | Expression | Name |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Measurement noise | S_noise = (KᵀSε⁻¹K + Sa⁻¹)⁻¹ KᵀSε⁻¹K Sa | Noise error |
| Smoothing | S_smooth = (A - I) Sa (A - I)ᵀ | Smoothing error |
| Forward model | S_FM = G Kb Sb Kbᵀ Gᵀ | Model parameter error |
| Total | Sₓ = S_noise + S_smooth + S_FM | Total error |

where G = (KᵀSε⁻¹K + Sa⁻¹)⁻¹ KᵀSε⁻¹ is the gain matrix and Kb is
the Jacobian with respect to model parameters b (e.g., spectroscopic data).
